Emeralds and jade withdrawn from the clear jewel box
Hidden away, to shelter the bright green, sometimes subdued 
and sometimes with streaks of regal purple or flaming orange, 
but which do exude the most fragrant of fragrances —
dank, fresh, organic — correcting any mood!

The gems meet the determined fingers
crumbling, like a sand castle being viciously washed
away, raining over the jet-black solid metal tray;
Forming a river, nay, a sea of green, and now it was time to clean.

For the opal rain wasn’t free of pollutants;
For the stems and seeds have quite some impudence;
For the stems prevent a seal, while the seeds burst mid meal!! 
So, the fingers caress the amalgamation
casting away the undesired, to damnation!

With the unwanted on the parapet, 
out comes a cigarette..
The fag pinched just enough
to let the tobacco pipette;
Minced mushrooms on a jade omelette

Next comes the card paper, quite stiff — the roach;
Naked flame hovers near, not to burn, but to poach; 
Making the paper stiffer still, the heat present only to coach

Then run across the table’s sharp edge,
“Roll me already” the curve of the paper did allege,
Five folds — always five — thus etched, 
The rest was rolled, ready to be wedged.

Finally, the thin, translucent, hemp paper is retrieved
from the sheathed book of tree skins, so tightly leaved.
A fold made along the length, a third of the way into the breadth,
is moistened and delicately ripped, then discarded;
While the larger half, courted, and neatly folded.

With the mise en place in place,
the thumb and the digits form a harness;
the roach now effaced within the winning half’s tight embrace
While the stuff from the base, fills up the remaining space

The left shuffles while the right shapes, tucking the paper unto itself;
Until only the gum is visible, for which the tongue is compelled
and in one decisive motion, it wets the adhesive,
prompting the right to perform the final checks on his thesis
before sealing shut, quite remarkable, his treatise.

Emeralds and jade withdrawn from the clear jewel box
Hidden away to shelter the bright green, sometimes subdued
with rare streaks of purple or orange on the jewels, which do exude
The most fragrant of fragrances — dank, fresh, organic — correcting any mood!

The gems meet the determined fingers — squashed
Crumbling, like a sand castle being viciously washed
away, raining over the jet-black solid metal tray;
Forming a river, nay, a sea of green, and now it was time to clean.

For the emerald rain was not free of pollutants,
The stems and seeds have quite some impudence
The stems prevent a seal, while the seeds burst mid meal!!
So, the fingers crease through the amalgamation
Casting away the non-desired, to damnation.

With the unwanted out on the parapet, out comes a cigarette
The material on the tray, like a small cushion, is set
The fag pinched just enough to let the tobacco pipette
Like minced mushrooms on a pesto omelette

Next comes the card paper, quite stiff — the roach
Naked flame hovers near, not to burn, but to poach
Making the paper firmer, more rigid, the heat present to coach

Run across the table’s sharp edge,
“Roll me already” the curve of the paper did allege, 
Five folds — always five — thus etched,
The rest was rolled, ready to be wedged.

Finally the thin, translucent, rice paper is retrieved 
From the sheathed book of skin peels so leaved.
A fold is made along the length,
a third of the way into the breadth
Moistened and delicately ripped, then discarded 
While the larger half, courted, neatly folded

With the mise en place in place,
The left index and thumb form a harness
for the tip, now effaced within the winning half’s tight embrace
While the stuff from the base, fills up the remaining space

The left shuffles while the right shapes, tucking the paper into itself
Until only the glue is visible, for which the tongue is compelled
Which in one decisive motion, wets the adhesive,
Prompting the right to perform the final checks on his thesis
Before sealing shut his quite remarkable treatise.
