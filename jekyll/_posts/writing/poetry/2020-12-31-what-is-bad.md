What makes something bad?
The goal? The outcome?
Or all the choices made along the way?

Or maybe bad isn’t really bad, but is actually good.
All it needs,
perhaps,
is time. And when in retrospect,
those decisions may seem required. Trials.
Bosses defeated in every instance.
And I like to think, that each boss comes with their own lesson.
And maybe that is the point.

Or maybe bad is actually bad;
but not for all.
After all,
my freedom fighter could be your terrorist; your martyr, my tyrant.
What then, makes something bad?

Is it like the dark? Simply an absence of good?
Good is fairly easy to define — like the light,
good promotes life. So the bad, must inhibit it.
Simple.
then again..
Who decides..
What hinders? What promotes?
Who has that foresight?!

And who’s to say
that light sustains life?
For the light burns, though slow, it ignites!
And without the dark, the flames engulf,
(phoenixes are only made up)
The light dying out,
killing everything with it, leaving nothing but its absence — 
the dark.

Is bad, then, just a consequence of good? 
Both complete and incomplete?
Removing it only guaranteeing its resurgence? 
And just as its exile was long,
Its prime perhaps longer? And in all that time, the quarries 
of the bad, or the absence of good, wait.
Impatiently.
Fervently.
Desperately.
For their messiah. And their messiah does arrive,
but he doesn’t deliver. For like the light, the messiah too ignites;
Carrying the dark within his light, blinding his disciples,
poor souls with no respite.
So what makes something bad?

Maybe there is no bad. No good, no better, no worse. 
No excellent, no terrible;
no fabulous, no despicable.
Things just are and to personify them is to 
Well
Person-ify them. Things are not persons!

Good.. Bad.. then, are perhaps just exercises in vanity
A naive way to pass the time,
a way to sedate ourselves though our unending march to our death.
The musings, nails that chip away from the rock face as we stare down into the abyss
all the while, the light cooking us away,
into the dark.

But..
Who decides? What inhibits and what promotes? 
Who has that foresight?!

And who’s to say that light
brings life?
For the light burns, though slow, it ignites.
And without the dark
maybe the flames engulf, and phoenixes are just imaginary,
and the light dies out..
Killing everything with it, leaving nothing, just its absence — the dark.

Removing it only guaranteeing its resurgence? 
And just as its exile was long,
Its prime perhaps longer? And in all that time, the victims
of the bad, or the absence of good, wait.
Impatiently.
Desperately.
Fervently.
For their Jesus. And their Jesus arrives.
But he doesn’t deliver. For like the light, Jesus too ignites.
Carries the dark within his light, the bad within his good.
So what makes something bad?

No excellent, no terrible;

Person-ify them. Things are not persons!

Good.. Bad.. then, are perhaps just exercises in vanity
A naive way to pass the time,
a way to sedate ourselves in our fleeting moments of consciousness;
Or perhaps a display of our arrogance — we have no control!
Or maybe, musings on the good or the bad are the nails
Chipping away from the rock face as we stare down into the abyss
While the light cooks us away into the dark.
What then, makes something bad?!
